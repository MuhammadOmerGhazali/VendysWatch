\section{Abstract}
VendysWatch is a comprehensive file system monitoring and integrity verification system designed to provide real-time monitoring of file system activities and ensure data integrity. The system combines Linux auditd capabilities with custom monitoring logic to track file modifications, access patterns, and potential security breaches.

\section{Introduction}
In today's digital environment, maintaining file system integrity and monitoring file access is crucial for both security and operational purposes. VendysWatch addresses these needs by providing a robust solution that:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Monitors file system activities in real-time
    \item Tracks file modifications and access patterns
    \item Verifies file integrity through cryptographic hashing
    \item Provides detailed audit logs of all file operations
    \item Offers a user-friendly interface for monitoring and management
\end{itemize}

\section{System Architecture}
The system is built using Rust and consists of several key components:

\subsection{Core Components}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Auditd Integration}: Leverages Linux auditd for low-level file system monitoring
    \item \textbf{Real-time Monitoring}: Continuous monitoring of specified directories
    \item \textbf{Integrity Verification}: Cryptographic hashing for file integrity checks
    \item \textbf{Logging System}: Comprehensive logging of all file operations
    \item \textbf{Database Storage}: Persistent storage of monitoring data
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Technical Implementation}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Programming Language}: Rust for performance and safety
    \item \textbf{Database}: SQLite for data persistence
    \item \textbf{File System Integration}: Linux auditd and inotify
    \item \textbf{User Interface}: Command-line interface with real-time updates
\end{itemize}

\section{Features}
\subsection{File Monitoring}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Real-time tracking of file modifications
    \item Access pattern monitoring
    \item Detailed audit logs with timestamps
    \item User and process tracking
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Security Features}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Cryptographic hashing for integrity verification
    \item Detailed audit trails
    \item Process and user identification
    \item Suspicious activity detection
\end{itemize}

\section{Implementation Details}
\subsection{File System Monitoring}
The system uses Linux auditd to monitor file system activities:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=Rust]
pub fn setup_auditd_rules(file_path: &str) -> Result<(), String> {
    // Setup comprehensive monitoring rules
    let rules = [
        vec!["-w", file_path, "-p", "rwxa", "-k", "file_operations"],
        vec!["-w", file_path, "-p", "wa", "-k", "dir_changes"],
        // Additional monitoring rules...
    ];
    // Implementation details...
}
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Integrity Verification}
File integrity is verified using cryptographic hashing:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=Rust]
pub fn calculate_file_hash(file_path: &str) -> Result<String, String> {
    // Calculate SHA-256 hash of file contents
    // Implementation details...
}
\end{lstlisting}

\section{Logging System}
\subsection{Importance of Comprehensive Logging}
The logging system in VendysWatch serves several critical purposes:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Security}: Detailed logs help identify and investigate security incidents
    \item \textbf{Compliance}: Maintains audit trails required by various regulations
    \item \textbf{Debugging}: Assists in troubleshooting system issues
    \item \textbf{Forensics}: Provides evidence for security investigations
    \item \textbf{Performance Monitoring}: Tracks system behavior and performance
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Logging Implementation}
The system implements a multi-level logging approach:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Rust]
pub struct Logger {
    file: File,
    level: LogLevel,
}

impl Logger {
    pub fn new(log_path: &str, level: LogLevel) -> Result<Logger, String> {
        // Implementation details...
    }

    pub fn log(&mut self, level: LogLevel, message: &str) -> Result<(), String> {
        // Implementation details...
    }
}
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Log Types and Levels}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{System Logs}: Track system-level events and errors
    \item \textbf{Audit Logs}: Record all file system activities
    \item \textbf{Security Logs}: Monitor security-related events
    \item \textbf{Performance Logs}: Track system performance metrics
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Log Management}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Rotation}: Automatic log rotation to prevent disk space issues
    \item \textbf{Retention}: Configurable retention periods for different log types
    \item \textbf{Compression}: Automatic compression of archived logs
    \item \textbf{Search}: Efficient log search capabilities
\end{itemize}

\section{Use Cases}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Security Monitoring}: Track unauthorized file access
    \item \textbf{Compliance}: Maintain audit trails for regulatory requirements
    \item \textbf{Data Integrity}: Ensure file contents remain unchanged
    \item \textbf{Forensics}: Investigate file system activities
\end{itemize}

\section{Conclusion}
VendysWatch provides a comprehensive solution for file system monitoring and integrity verification. Its combination of real-time monitoring, cryptographic verification, and detailed logging makes it suitable for various security and monitoring applications.

\section{Future Work}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Web-based dashboard for remote monitoring
    \item Machine learning for anomaly detection
    \item Integration with SIEM systems
